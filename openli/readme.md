<center><b>Lawful Intercept</b></center>
OpenLI is an open-source Lawful Intercept (LI) software solution, primarily developed by the WAND Network Research Group at the University of Waikato. It's designed to implement the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards for the interception of IP and IP Multimedia services, catering to network operators' needs to comply with lawful interception requirements as mandated in various jurisdictions.

For more detail refer to [https://www.openli.nz/tutorials/](https://www.openli.nz/tutorials/) and [https://github.com/OpenLI-NZ/openli/wiki/OpenLI-Tutorial](https://github.com/OpenLI-NZ/openli/wiki/OpenLI-Tutorial)

The ETSI standard for Lawful Interception is ETSI TS 102 232. This standard defines the HI2 and HI3 interfaces, which are used by Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to transmit intercepted signaling (HI2) and content (HI3) to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs).
